Rhythm based game similar to Guitar Hero. Users tap on the falling notes at the correct time to score points. Bonuses are awarded for longer streaks. If the player misses too many notes, it's game over.

To play the game, this project needs to be downloaded and opened in Unity. After building the game in Unity in can then be opened on a physical or virtual device. (Note: Building this game for iOS requires macOS)
